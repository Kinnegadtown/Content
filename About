  Who we are:
In recent times there have been some tremendous difficulties facing Kinnegad's local charitable groups and organisations with regard to their efforts in relation to event coordination, fundraising, volunteer support, finding committee members etc.
Although this website is a new creation, it can be only hoped that it will gain momentum quickly and itself will benefit from the co-operation of like-minded individuals within Kinnegad and it's surrounding areas. As such, this section will be updated with details of those individuals as soon as they get on board.
   
   What we do:
Kinnegadtown.ie was created to act as a central information hub for local events and local community based organisations operating on a voluntary or not-for-profit basis for the betterment of the members of the community of Kinnegad and it's surrounding areas.
  
  Our main objectives:

          - Provide a central information forum for the local community
          - Ensure all local groups/organisations are aware of all funding possibilities
          - Create a wider volunteer base for each group/organisation
          - Establish a local Community Center & Community Notice Board
          - Assist local groups with finding committee members
          - Re-start the Kinnegad Secondary School campaign
          - Establish a Care & Repair service for older & vulnerable people in Kinnegad
